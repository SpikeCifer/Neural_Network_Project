# Neural_Network_Project
This is my first neural Network project. It has to do with the LVQ algorithm

In simples terms, the program first asks the user if he wants it to create a new text file with random examples 
,based on a few simple conditions. Next, the program asks for the number of Neurons as well as the max number of seasons.
Once it get the answers to theses questions, it creates N random neurons (where N is the given number),
initiating them from N Random examples. After that, it executes the LVQ algorithm getting the team faults. 
This process is repeated 5 times and in the end, the program keeps the best neurons (the set with the minimum team fault).
Finally, it produces in a simple JAVAFX window that shows the examples along with the neuron-centers found
